{rdo}[*RDO*] is a {rdo}[community] distribution of OpenStack which
strives to provide the latest upstream code packaged for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

NOTE: {redhat}[*Red Hat*] also provides {rhosp}[Red Hat Enterprise
Linux OpenStack Platform] (*{rhosp}[RHEL-OSP]*) which is based on
{rdo}[*RDO*].

== Relation to upstream

{rdo}[*RDO*] is a distribution of upstream code, not a fork. We strive
to keep {rdo}[*RDO*] as close to upstream as possible with the minimum
number of downstream patches.

== Open Governance

When Red Hat launched the RDO commnity in April 2013, we chose to
focus our energies on making an OpenStack distribution available and
encouraging a self-supporting community of users around the
distribution, related tools, and supporting documentation. With this
community now established, it is clear we need to prioritize opening
up the RDO development process. Or, to put it another way, it is time
to begin opening up the technical governance of RDO.

This process will be discussed and fleshed out in more detail on
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list[rdo-list@redhat.com].
